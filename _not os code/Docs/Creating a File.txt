;In order for a file to be viewable in os3, it must begin with an appropriate file header.

;File headers are formatted as follows :
;	
;	dd fileSize	; (NOT including the header, sizez of the actual data)
;	times ? db fileType, 0
;	times ? db fileName, 0
;
;EX:
;	dd 0x48000
;	db "Image", 0
;	db "SplashScreen", 0


;	TIPS :
;		- The file header MUST be the first thing present in a file.
;		- Instead of generating file headers by hand, use the FileHeaderTool.
;		- By giving a file a commonly used type, it will be openable in more applications.
