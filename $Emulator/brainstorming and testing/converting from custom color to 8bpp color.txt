Dolphin.handleVESAcolor	; color in al

IF non vesa
rep color through eax
	ex: 0xab -> 0xabababab
IF 32bpp
find equiv color somehow...
	ex: 0xFF -> 0x00ffffff


0b [bb gg rr] is non vesa color scheme
BUT: 0xFF is WHITE

first: if 0xff change it to white (and maybe handle any remaining gradients?)
second: 
	and color, 0x3
	imul color, 85
	mov stor, color

	and color, 0xC
	rsh color, 2
	imul color, 85
	lsh color, 8
	or stor, color

	and color, 0x30
	rsh color, 4
	imul color, 85
	lsh color, 16
	or stor, color
	
	TADA!

ALSO:: need to make View on text files MUCH more efficient (so many wasted cycles)
