atm 34391 bytes... some of which can be offloaded eventually to the filesystem
aka 44 sectors of actual code

currently loading 126 sectors in the bootloader...

leaves 126-44= 82 sectors left to use

82 sectors = 0xA400 aka 41,984 bytes aka safely assume 40kb per transfer?
at which rate it would take 59 reads to read a 1024*768*3 image to the filesystem. ugh.
assuming it can transfer and reboot in ~15 seconds it will take approx 15 minutes to transfer an image??

hmmmng time to figure out jumping back to real mode so BIOS can do all the USB driver work without needing to reboot...

ALTHOUGH the above currently loading number can maybe be raised a lot by having multiple loads called?
