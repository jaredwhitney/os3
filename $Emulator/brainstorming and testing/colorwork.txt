total of 255 slots

tr*tb*tg must = 255

cubert 255 = 6.34 -> 6 total colors in each

only 216 (0xd8) colors will actually be used


the space between each color should be 255/6 = 42.5 -> 42 (0x2a)

so:
255, 255, 255  (/42) -> 6, 6, 6 (infm) -> 0-6, 0-6, 0-6 -> 258 (overflow...) EDIT: 5 should be used everywhere instead of 6; 5 colors + 0 = 6 colors

CLAMP anything over 216 to 216?

255,255,255->216,216,216->5,5,5-> 215 -> 5,5,5->210,210,210 ...
122, 0, 255->122,  0,216->2,0,5->  77 -> 2,0,5->
