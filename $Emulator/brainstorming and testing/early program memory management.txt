program requests x sectors
	PM stores the mem location of them, performs a malloc(x)

obj creation requests x bytes
	PM advances the creation offs and returns the bytes (no freeing memory atm)

program requests an object
	PM uses the offs provided to return the value
		to get subVars use value returned by PM as the new offs
