Assembler
	for each line
		run along using Syntax-like searching to find keywords
		create machine-code equivalent
		save to RAM (allocated earlier) (how to determine how much to allocate?)
Text editor
	runs much like iConsole
	enter key simply adds 0x0A
	some key (CTRL+S ?) calculates size and dumps text buffer to the end of the filesystem (this is not the best way to do this, but it is the simplest)
Window Manager
	SHIFT should be a required modifier on all CAPS, TAB, and ARROW presses
	ESCAPE should close the current window
	SHIFT+ESCAPE should lock the computer
	(GUI+UP ?) should maximize the window
	(GUI+DOWN ?) should minimize the window

To-Do list :
	VESA modes
	Paging
	That stuff ^
