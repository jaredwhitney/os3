get a list of active ports
allocate memory for components, set their addresses

send an identify command
wait for it to return
check to make sure it is valid

// do anything else that you want to do!



need code to: 
get active port list
allocate memory for all structures for each port
create all of the FIS types
handle the interrupt
read partition tables!!~!


allocation (per port) :
ealloc(1) = command list
ealloc(1) = FIS (only 256 bytes used)
ealloc(8) = command table
