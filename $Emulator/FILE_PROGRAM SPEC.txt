IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS

they NEED to be loaded into a filesystem
and dumped after the kernel.
NOT compiled with it
or there will be problems.

programs dumped after kernel defined as :

	dd size		; the file's size in bytes
	dd "PRGM"	; the filetype
	dd name, name	; the file's name ('XXXXXXXX')

	db type		; the program's type
	dd post_init.Loc	; pointer to the postinit function
	
	init:
		; code
	ret
	
	post_init:
		; code
	ret

on boot the kernel will load the first program it finds (console)
