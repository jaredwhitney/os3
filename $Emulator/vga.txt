1 byte read, 2 byte writes
0xa0000-0xbffff

x3c8, x3c9, x3c7 control DAC
	18 bits, 6 bits for each color component
		color index to port 0x3C8
		3 bytes to 0x3C9 in the order red, green, blue
		first entry's index to 0x3C8 then write all values to 0x3C9 in the order red, green, blue, red, green, blue, and so on
		To read the DAC entries, write the index to be read to 0x3C7, then read the bytes from port 0x3C9
