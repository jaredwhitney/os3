{"name":"Os3","tagline":"A custom-built operating system.","body":"## Intent\r\nOs3 is an operating system written in x86 assembly code (Intel syntax). It is was started as a project whose main intents are to both educate the author on the workings of and challenges involved in developing the low-level components of an operating system, and explore unorthodox implementations of such systems.\r\n\r\n## Compatability\r\nAs such, systems are being redesigned where possible, so Os3 is not likely to be compatible with any existing software. It uses a custom filesystem, and as such will also not be able to load external files that have not been modified to match its specifications.\r\n\r\n## Development Builds\r\nNo stable release of Os3 is available at the moment, so use the development version with caution. The current version has been tested with, and runs properly on: Bochs (Emulator), and Pentium 4 processors. In order to run Os3, computers will need a minimum of 6.4 megabytes of RAM.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nWhile Os3 is being developed by a single developer, its creation would not have been possible without help from a number of outside sources. Integral to its development have been: \"Writing a Simple Operating System from Scratch\" by Nick Blundell (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf), and both the forums and wiki of http://osdev.org.","google":"UA-61296022-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
